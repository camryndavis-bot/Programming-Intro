Using number keys, you can cycle through eight sky options, choose from five different wall materials, three tower styles, three gate designs, and a variety of scenery additions like flying birds, crossed swords, and flags. Toggle features like a moat, battlements, and flickering torches to bring your castle to life. When you're done building, press 9 to watch your fortress get struck down in flames, then rebuild and start over. The best part is you can enjoy some ambient music playing in the background. This was made for any dark fantasy or customizable game lovers. Enjoy! <p> <a href=https://editor.p5js.org/bcjacobs/sketches/IhHSvjyZJ>view code</a>");
